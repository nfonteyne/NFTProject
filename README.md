# NFT Project


This project is here to help charity and help unknown artists get some recognition by using the system of NFT.

Our application will create NFT of works made by artists and put them on the market. When some money is invested into our charity porfolio, the money is treated to be given to the original artist and .

The basis of this concept is that by investing money into the NFTs of one of our artist, you will recieve a badge that indicate that you've invested money into charitable work, you can then put this badge on you social medias to show all your friends what charity interest you and what you have done for them.

Depending on the amount you invest, you will get a different badge, greater amount will result in you getting a badge that's more uncommon, which will indicate that you've given a lot of money.

The Badges will by in the form of an NFT that's not transferable from one user to another
